# Healthcare-Data-analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a healthcare analytics solution. Using a dataset of 55,500 unique patient records collected from 10 major hospitals across the United States, the dashboard uncovers patterns in patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments, medications, cost distribution, and hospital performance. This analysis aims to support healthcare administrators and hospital managers in making informed decisions.

## Objectives
The analysis and dashboard were designed to identify the following:
- Patient Demographics 
- Medical Conditions Trends 
- Length of Stay Analysis.
- Treatment Cost Evaluation 
- Hospital Performance 
- Medication Insights
- Admission Type Effect
- Insurance Analytics
- Geographical Differences

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX for calculated columns and measures
- Power BI Visualization Tools

## Data Source
The healthcare data was from DataDNA challenge hosted by Onyx Data [DOwnload here](https://onyxdata.co.uk/data-dna-dataset-challenge/)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The dataset was cleaned in Excel:
- I Removed duplicates from patient records
- Standardized blood type, admission type, and condition categories
- Created new columns
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation or category grouping

## Dashboard Sections
The dashboard is divided into four main pages (based on navigation tabs):
### Patient's Insight
- Demographics
- Blood Type
- Age Group
- Common Conditions
- Doctors with the highest patient count
### Cost & Insurance
- Billing by hospital
- Billing by insurance provider
- Admission type billing
- Treatment cost vs. length of stay
### Regional Insight
- Hospital locations on U.S. map
- Patient distribution across hospitals
### Hospital Performance
- Number of patients by hospital
- Length of stay trends

## Identified Key Insights
1. Adults comprise the largest patient segment (25,000 patients).
2. Hypertension, Diabetes, and Obesity represent the top medical conditions.
3. The average length of stay is consistently between 15 and 16 days, regardless of the condition.
4. Emergency admissions lead to a slightly longer stay compared to urgent or elective admissions.
5. Large billing differences exist across hospitals, with Houston and UCLA hospitals driving the highest costs.
6. Medicare covers the highest population but also sees the highest aggregated billing amounts.
7. Medications are used fairly consistently, but Lipitor is the most prescribed overall.

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of patient demographics, billing patterns, treatment trends, and hospital performance across the U.S. healthcare system. By bringing these elements together, it supports stakeholders in identifying emerging trends in medical conditions, improving hospital operations, and enhancing patient outcomes. It also helps uncover the key drivers behind treatment costs and offers a clearer understanding of how insurance providers influence overall healthcare spending. Overall, the analysis equips decision-makers with the insights needed to make informed, data-driven improvements in healthcare delivery.
